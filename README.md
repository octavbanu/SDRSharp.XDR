# SDRSharp.XDR
This is Server for XDR-GTK
It doesn't do much yet
but things that work are:
  * Signal Meter
  * Filter Bandwith
  * Tunning
  * Modulation select (AM/FM)
  * Squelch (exept Stereo Squelch as I don't know what that is)
  * Stereo Indicator (Thanks Youssef for adding FmPilotIsDetected to ISharpControl in SDR# rev 1702)
  
 What does not work:
  * RDS
  * AGC Threshold (don't know what this does :()
  * Antena Switch (have nothing to switch so no use for it yet)
  * RF/IF Gain boost (SDR# doesn't expose any methods for that)
  * Volume control (you could control your PC volume with that or SDR# volume :))
  * Stereo de-emphasis switch (no way of switching it from SDR# eather so :()
